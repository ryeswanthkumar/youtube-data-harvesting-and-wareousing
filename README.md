Data Harvesting:

YouTube Data API: You'll need to use the YouTube Data API to fetch data from YouTube. This can include information about videos, channels, comments, etc. You'll need to set up a Google Cloud Platform project, enable the YouTube Data API, and obtain API credentials (API key) to access the API.
Python Script: Write a Python script using a library like google-api-python-client to interact with the YouTube Data API. This script should authenticate with your API key and make API requests to fetch the desired data. You can schedule this script to run periodically using tools like cron jobs or task schedulers.
Data Warehousing:

MySQL Database: Set up a MySQL database to store the harvested YouTube data. You'll need to design a schema that fits your data model, including tables for videos, channels, comments, etc. Use tools like MySQL Workbench to design and manage your database schema.
Python Database Interaction: Write Python code to connect to your MySQL database and insert/update data retrieved from the YouTube API. You can use libraries like mysql-connector-python or an ORM like SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
Streamlit Web App:

Pandas: Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008

Installation: Install Streamlit using pip install streamlit if you haven't already.
App Development: Create a Streamlit web app using Python. Your app should have features to query and display data from your MySQL database. You can use widgets like dropdowns, sliders, and text inputs to allow users to filter and search for specific YouTube data.
Database Querying: Use SQL queries (via a library like mysql-connector-python) within your Streamlit app to retrieve data from the MySQL database based on user input.
Data Visualization: Utilize Streamlit's built-in components for data visualization, such as charts, tables, and maps, to present the YouTube data in a meaningful and interactive way.
Deployment:

Local Deployment: Initially, you can run your Streamlit app locally for testing and development using streamlit run your_app.py in your terminal.
Cloud Deployment: Once your app is ready, you can deploy it to cloud platforms like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform, or AWS. Each platform has its deployment process, but generally, you'll need to containerize your app (e.g., using Docker) and configure the necessary server infrastructure.
Security and Optimization:

API Key Security: Ensure that you securely manage and store your YouTube API key to prevent unauthorized access.
Database Security: Implement proper authentication and access control mechanisms for your MySQL database to protect sensitive data.
Performance Optimization: Optimize your code and database queries for performance, especially if dealing with a large volume of YouTube data.
By following these steps, you can create a functional YouTube data harvesting and warehousing system using MySQL for storage and Streamlit for the user interface. Remember to adhere to YouTube's API usage policies and best practices for data handling and privacy.
